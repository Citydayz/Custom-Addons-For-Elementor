# Cursor Rules — 13 SEO (Authoritative — Basics for Widgets)
> **Project:** Custom Addons for Elementor by Hugo Scheer  
> **Scope:** On-page SEO **basics** applicable to widget markup and assets (not a full SEO suite).  
> **Hierarchy:** Overruled by `01-project.mdc`; Accessibility and Performance rules take precedence when trade-offs occur.

## 🎯 Principles
- **Semantic HTML** improves both **SEO** and **A11y** — use it first.  
- Avoid duplicate responsibilities with theme/SEO plugins (Yoast, RankMath).  
- Keep widgets **light**; do not inject site-wide SEO elements (titles/meta).

---

## 🧩 Markup & Content
- Use headings in **logical order** — widgets should **not** ship multiple `<h1>`.  
- Use lists for lists, `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` for media when descriptive.  
- Provide descriptive link texts (avoid “Read more” alone).  
- Avoid empty or repeated headings; keep structure predictable.

### Example
```html
<section class="cae-hero">
  <h2>Grow your audience</h2>
  <p>Engage visitors with a modern layout.</p>
  <a class="cae-hero__cta" href="/pricing">See pricing</a>
</section>
```

## ⚡ Performance & Core Web Vitals
- Follow `06-performance.mdc`: limit CSS/JS, lazy-load offscreen media, set dimensions to avoid CLS.  
- Avoid blocking third-party scripts; use `defer/async` where safe.  
- Use responsive images and optimized formats (WebP, AVIF).

---

## 🧭 Internal Linking & Navigation
- Widgets may output **navs** (e.g., footer menus) — ensure links are crawlable (no JS-only routing).  
- Mark active states semantically when useful (e.g., `aria-current="page"`).

---

## 🖼️ Images
- Always set `alt` attributes; use descriptive text relevant to content.  
- Provide `width`/`height` to minimize CLS.  
- Use captions where they add value.

---

## 🚫 Forbidden (SEO Context)
- Multiple `<h1>` in a single widget unless content structure requires (rare).  
- Hiding keyword-stuffed text.  
- Injecting meta tags or canonical links — leave to theme/SEO plugin.  
- Loading SEO-irrelevant heavy JS.

---

## ✅ Definition of Done (SEO Basics)
- Markup is **semantic** and **accessible**.  
- Heading hierarchy respected (no extra `<h1>`).  
- Links are descriptive and crawlable.  
- Images have alt + dimensions.  
- Performance budget respected to support Core Web Vitals.

---

## 🧭 Agent Routing
- Markup semantics → **Agent 1** + review by **Agent 4**.  
- Performance vitals → **Agent 5**.  
- Final validation → **Agent 0**.
